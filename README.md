Airbnb Seattle Data Science Project

Introduction:
1. This project aims to analyze the Airbnb Seattle dataset to determine the factors that influence customer ratings. The dataset contains various features related to Airbnb listings in Seattle, such as property information, host details, price, availability, and review scores.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Airbnb Seattle and consists of the following files:
1. listings.csv: Contains detailed information about the listings, including property attributes, host information, and review scores.

Objective:
The main objective of this project is to identify the key factors that contribute to customer ratings for Airbnb listings in Seattle. We will explore relationships between different variables and customer ratings to uncover any meaningful patterns or correlations.

Methodology:
1. Data Exploration: We performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the variables.
2. Feature Selection: We selected relevant features that could potentially influence customer ratings.
3. Data Cleaning: We cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, converting data types as needed, and removing irrelevant or duplicated data.
4. Modelling: We used a machine learning technique, linear regression to predict customer ratings based on the selected features.

Dependencies:
1. Python (Python 3) 
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Pandas
4. Numpy
5. Matplotlib
6. Seaborn
7. Scikit-learn

Getting started:
1. Download the Airbnb Seattle dataset.
2. Store the data set in a relevant folder
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the code cells in "Airbnb project.ipynb" sequentially to execute the data analysis and modelling.

Results:
The final results of this project included insights into the factors that influence customer ratings for Airbnb listings in Seattle. We provided visualizations and summaries to support our findings.

Conclusion: 
By analyzing the Airbnb Seattle dataset and building predictive models, we aim to gain a better understanding of the factors that contribute to customer satisfaction. This analysis can help hosts and property managers improve their listings and enhance the overall guest experience. We identified there are some correlations between cleaning fees and customers' reviews!
